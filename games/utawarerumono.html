         <h2>Team Attacks & Pairings</h2>
         <p>In Utawarerumono, you can use Zeal points to execute a Team Attack. Team Attacks can only be used when certain characters are all within 2 squares of an enemy. Each attack has a unique effect, from raw damage to healing to status ailments, or even a mixture of those various elements. They cost 2/3 of the character that initiates's Zeal points, and only 1/2 of the Zeal points of any other character involved. </p>
         <p>Keep in mind also that each attack can only be executed by the <strong>FIRST</strong> character in each bullet point below. If you try it in any other order, the prompt will not show.</p>
         <h3>Pairings for Team Attacks</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Hakuoro & Oboro</li>
             <li>Eruruu & Aruruu</li>
             <li>Aruruu & Kamyu</li>
             <li>Oboro & Dorii + Guraa (both must be within range)</li>
             <li>Dorii & Guraa</li>
             <li>Dorii & Guraa</li>
             <li>Benawi & Kurou</li>
             <li>Kurou & Oboro</li>
             <li>Karura & Touka</li>
             <li>Touka & Aruruu</li>
             <li>Touka, Aruruu, Gachyatara</li>
             <li>Urutorii & Karura</li>
             <li>Kamyu & Urutorii</li>
         </ul>
         <p>From this, we can see that the characters that will most commonly be able to be used for team attacks are:</p>
         <ol>
             <li>Aruruu (4 pairings)</li>
             <li>Oboro, Dorii, & Guraa (3 pairings)</li>
             <li>Kurou, Karura, & Urutorii (2 pairings)</li>
         </ol>
         <p>You may want to think about this ranking if you want Team Attacks to be your primary strategy for winning battles.</p>
